                    For the RS7 Performance, Audi fits 22-inch alloys, air suspension, all-wheel steering, an RS sports exhaust system, an extending rear spoiler and Matrix LED headlights. 
                    In the cabin you'll find RS sports seats in Valcona leather, an RS steering wheel, twin touch screens, a Bang & Olufsen sound system and ambient lighting.
                    As the name suggests, you get a lot of black detailing with the Carbon Black trim. That includes the 22-inch alloys and exterior badging, while there's also a lot of matte carbon trim pieces, such as on the wing mirrors, front spoiler and rear diffuser. 
                    You can also choice between black, grey or blue trim detailing in the cabin, which goes alongside the black headlining and rear sunscreen.
                    With this top-spec Carbon Vorsprung, the RS7 Performance gets heated seats throughout, power-assisted closing doors, a panoramic sunroof and USB-C charging ports in the back. 
                    There's also RS sports suspension, the Tour Pack with adaptive cruise control and lane assist, and the City Assist Pack with intersection assist and rear cross-traffic alert.
